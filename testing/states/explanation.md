Okay, let's break down how we figured out the roles of `data[2]` and `data[3]` and the encoding.

1.  **Observation from Raw Data:** The key insight comes from examining the raw data logs you provided in the `states/` directory (like `states/neutral`, `states/leftgothit`, `states/rightgothit`, etc.). By comparing the byte sequences across these different known states, we can identify which bytes change consistently when the state changes.
    *   In `states/neutral`, we see the pattern `[..., 4, 80, 4, 80, ...]`.
    *   In `states/leftgothit` (meaning the Right player was hit by the Left player), the pattern changes to `[..., 4, 114, 4, 114, ...]`. Notice `data[3]` changed from 80 to 114.
    *   In `states/rightgothit` (meaning the Left player was hit by the Right player), the pattern is `[..., 44, 80, 44, 80, ...]`. Notice `data[2]` changed from 4 to 44.
    *   In `states/lefthitself`, the pattern is `[..., 38, 80, 38, 80, ...]`. `data[2]` changed from 4 to 38.
    *   In `states/rightselfhit`, the pattern is `[..., 4, 120, 4, 120, ...]`. `data[3]` changed from 80 to 120.
    *   In `states/both_hitting`, the pattern is `[..., 44, 114, 44, 114, ...]`. Both `data[2]` and `data[3]` have changed compared to neutral.
    *   Similar analysis applies to the disconnected states (`0` for `data[2]`, `64` for `data[3]`).

2.  **Identifying Independent Bytes:** From these comparisons, it becomes clear that:
    *   The byte at index `2` (`data[2]`) consistently changes based on the actions or status of the **Left** player.
    *   The byte at index `3` (`data[3]`) consistently changes based on the actions or status of the **Right** player.
    *   The first two bytes (`data[0]`, `data[1]`) seem to be a counter or timestamp and a report ID (common in HID).
    *   Bytes `data[2]` and `data[3]` appear to be the most immediate and definitive indicators of the current state for the left and right players, respectively.
    *   The subsequent bytes (`data[4]` through `data[41]`) are **not** simple padding. Observation of state transitions (like in `testing/unknowntorightneutral`) shows that these later bytes reflect the state change with a slight delay, sometimes showing a mix of the previous and current state values for a few report cycles before stabilizing. This suggests some internal buffering or delayed propagation within the device's reporting mechanism.
    *   **Potential Purpose of Later Bytes:** This buffering/delay likely serves a purpose within the VSM's firmware, possibly related to how traditional fencing scoring boxes operate:
        *   **Debouncing:** The device might require a state change (like a hit) to persist through several internal cycles (represented by propagation through these later byte pairs) before considering it a stable, valid signal. This helps filter out noise from brief, accidental contacts.
        *   **Timing Logic Preparation:** In standard fencing (especially foil and sabre), complex timing rules (like lockout periods after a valid hit) are crucial. These buffered states could be inputs to internal logic designed to evaluate such timing rules, even if this specific VSM doesn't fully implement the entire scoring logic itself. It might be mimicking the data structure needed for such processing.
        *   **Fixed Report Size:** The need to fill the fixed 42-byte HID report size is also a factor. Exposing this internal state buffer is a practical way to meet the report size requirement.
    *   **Current Approach:** While these later bytes offer insight into potential internal processing, for our application's logic, we continue to focus on the first occurrence (`data[2]` and `data[3]`) as the most immediate and primary indicators of the current player states.

3.  **Decoding the Values:** The specific numeric values (4, 44, 38, 0, 20 for the left player; 80, 114, 120, 64, 84 for the right player) are essentially **arbitrary codes** defined by the VSM device's firmware. There isn't necessarily a deeper mathematical or bitwise encoding scheme that's immediately obvious. It's a direct mapping:
    *   `data[2] == 4` means Left player is NORMAL.
    *   `data[2] == 44` means Left player is HITTING_OPPONENT.
    *   `data[3] == 80` means Right player is NORMAL.
    *   `data[3] == 114` means Right player is HITTING_OPPONENT.
    *   ...and so on.

4.  **Implementation in `detect_hit_state`:** The function `detect_hit_state` in `main.py` directly implements this observed mapping. It takes the raw `data`, extracts `byte2 = data[2]` and `byte3 = data[3]`, and uses `if/elif/else` chains to translate these numeric codes into the human-readable status strings (like `STATUS_NORMAL`, `STATUS_HITTING_OPPONENT`, etc.) for each player independently, returning them as a tuple `(left_status, right_status)`.
