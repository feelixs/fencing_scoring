Okay, let's break down how we figured out the roles of `data[2]` and `data[3]` and the encoding.

1.  **Observation from Raw Data:** The key insight comes from examining the raw data logs you provided in the `states/` directory (like `states/neutral`, `states/leftgothit`, `states/rightgothit`, etc.). By comparing the byte sequences across these different known states, we can identify which bytes change consistently when the state changes.
    *   In `states/neutral`, we see the pattern `[..., 4, 80, 4, 80, ...]`.
    *   In `states/leftgothit` (meaning the Right player was hit by the Left player), the pattern changes to `[..., 4, 114, 4, 114, ...]`. Notice `data[3]` changed from 80 to 114.
    *   In `states/rightgothit` (meaning the Left player was hit by the Right player), the pattern is `[..., 44, 80, 44, 80, ...]`. Notice `data[2]` changed from 4 to 44.
    *   In `states/lefthitself`, the pattern is `[..., 38, 80, 38, 80, ...]`. `data[2]` changed from 4 to 38.
    *   In `states/rightselfhit`, the pattern is `[..., 4, 120, 4, 120, ...]`. `data[3]` changed from 80 to 120.
    *   In `states/both_hitting`, the pattern is `[..., 44, 114, 44, 114, ...]`. Both `data[2]` and `data[3]` have changed compared to neutral.
    *   Similar analysis applies to the disconnected states (`0` for `data[2]`, `64` for `data[3]`).

2.  **Identifying Independent Bytes:** From these comparisons, it becomes clear that:
    *   The byte at index `2` (`data[2]`) consistently changes based on the actions or status of the **Left** player.
    *   The byte at index `3` (`data[3]`) consistently changes based on the actions or status of the **Right** player.
    *   The first two bytes (`data[0]`, `data[1]`) seem to be a counter and a report ID (common in HID), and the subsequent bytes often repeat the pattern of bytes 2 and 3. We focus on the first occurrence (`data[2]` and `data[3]`) as the primary indicators.

3.  **Decoding the Values:** The specific numeric values (4, 44, 38, 0, 20 for the left player; 80, 114, 120, 64, 84 for the right player) are essentially **arbitrary codes** defined by the VSM device's firmware. There isn't necessarily a deeper mathematical or bitwise encoding scheme that's immediately obvious. It's a direct mapping:
    *   `data[2] == 4` means Left player is NORMAL.
    *   `data[2] == 44` means Left player is HITTING_OPPONENT.
    *   `data[3] == 80` means Right player is NORMAL.
    *   `data[3] == 114` means Right player is HITTING_OPPONENT.
    *   ...and so on.

4.  **Implementation in `detect_hit_state`:** The function `detect_hit_state` in `main.py` directly implements this observed mapping. It takes the raw `data`, extracts `byte2 = data[2]` and `byte3 = data[3]`, and uses `if/elif/else` chains to translate these numeric codes into the human-readable status strings (like `STATUS_NORMAL`, `STATUS_HITTING_OPPONENT`, etc.) for each player independently, returning them as a tuple `(left_status, right_status)`.
